<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Paul, 54, decided that I needed to finally develop my skills a little more, rather 
  than just being a VB6 and SQL developer.</p>

<p>Currently working for a fantastic company with great people, just wanted to increase my
  knowledge and maybe help a few people if they want some websites building.
